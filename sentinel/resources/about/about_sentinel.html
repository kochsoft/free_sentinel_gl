Back in the day in 1986 the Sentinel of Firebird was Geoff Crammond's
masterpiece bringing one of the first realistic 3D environments
onto the technically comparatively limited Commodore 64.

The ingenuity of the game was in having rules that allow only for
panning around but not for actual lateral movement. As such it
was possible to once render the whole environment
of a 360 degree view, including up and down, and then having the
player just browse this 2D image as he turns around surveying his
environment.

As for the game itself the simple elegance of rules and graphics
has lost none of its appeal even today.
