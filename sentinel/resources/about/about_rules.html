<h1>General Rules</h1>
<p>
Strong on his mountain tower stands the Sentinel overlooking
the landscape. In order to pass beyond, the synthoid must surpass
the Sentinel, absorb his energy, and enter hyperspace from the
top of his tower. Only there the surrounding gravity is
feeble enough for an escape into a foreign landscape.
</p>
<p>
You are the synthoid, an artificial consciousness
giving life to an otherwise inert robot. These robots cannot
walk. However, they can look around and manifest and absorb
matter within the landscape they survey spending and
gaining energy for the synthoid. They may absorb any
object which's square they can directly see and manifest trees,
boulders and other robot shells.
</p>
<p>
Trees. Trees grow in the landscapes. They have an energy value
of roughly one third of a robot. They may benefit the synthoid
as an energy source for absorption.
An antagonist may transform a tree into
a meanie for a brief period of time.
</p>
<p>
Boulders. Boulders are a speciality that only the synthoid may
manifest. They are special in that they may be interacted with
directly without having to be able to see the square they are
resting on. They are also special in being flat and massive
enough that other objects may be stacked onto them.
Although inert, due to their great mass their energy value is
about the equivalent of two trees.
</p>
<p>
Robots. A robot is a sophisticated device that may actually hold
a synthoid consciousness. Interact with it directly in order to
transfer the synthoid consciousness into a new robot. The old
robot will be left behind. A new robot will always face the position
of the energy source fueling its manifestation.
</p>
<p>
Sentries and the Sentinel are the main antagonists of the synthoid
and will attempt to absorb its energy distributing it within their
landscape. They turn around their own axes in order to scan for
any energy signature of absorbable objects. They will attack
any energy source that is larger than a single tree and reduce it
to tree value distributing the gained energy into new trees
within their field of view. If they attack the synthoid they
will do the same with his energy stockpiles. If these are depleted
the synthoid will be absorbed and the game is lost.
</p>
<p>
Meanies. In order to attack the synthoid the sentries and the Sentinel,
too, need to survey the landscape floor the synthoid's robot is
situated on. Sometimes they can see the robot but not the floor
beneath it. In that case they will attempt to transmute trees in the
environment around the synthoid into meanies. A meanie will spin
once and then return to being a tree again.
However, if, during that period, the meanie can lock onto the
synthoid's robot it will
instantly invert said robot's hyperdrive coil flux initiating
an unscheduled hyperdrive jump. Meanies may be absorbed like any
other object.
</p>
<p>
Note that while it is necessary for the antagonists to actually
see the ground under the synthoid's robot in order to absorb it,
the same does not hold true for any inert structure.
These they can absorb even if they are partially obstructed from
their view.

<ul>
<li><i>A</i>: Absorb the top object of the stack on the square or boulder
under the mouse.</li>
<li><i>T</i>: Manifest a tree onto the square or boulder under the mouse.</li>
<li><i>B</i>: Manifest a boulder onto the square or boulder under the mouse.</li>
<li><i>R</i>: Manifest a robot shell onto the square or boulder under the mouse.</li>
<li><i>Q</i>: Transfer the synthoid's consciousness into the robot shell under the mouse.</li>
<li><i>U, right mouse button click</i>: Perform an instantaneous u-turn.</li>
<li><i>H</i>: Initiate hyperspace jump. Will cost three units of energy randomly
manifesting a new robot shell within the landscape and transfering the
synthoid's consciousness therein. Due to gravimetric distortion the random
destination never is on higher altitude than the point of origin.</li>
<li><i>Space bar, left mouse button click</i>: Start and stop free roaming mode. If
free roaming mode is turned off the view will not continue to pan following the mouse.</li>
<li><i>F</i>: Toggle full screen mode.</li>
<li><i>S</i>: Rather a remnant from debugging than anything else this will identify
what is under the mouse right now.</li>
<li><i>W</i>: Answers the question: 'Where am I?'</li>
<li><i>+, mouse wheel towards computer</i>: Zoom in.</li>
<li><i>-, mouse wheel towards self</i>: Zoom out.</li>
