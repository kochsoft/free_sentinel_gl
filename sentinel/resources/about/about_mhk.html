When, in February 2015, my termed contract with the
Medizinisches Proteom-Center at the Ruhr University in Bochum,
Germany, ran out and new project proposals were declined
I found myself looking for a new job within a natural scientific
development environment.
</p>
<p>
While being on the lookout for a new position I also decided
to pursue what I felt to be a life-long todo learning and applying
in a sensible program the basics of OpenGL.
</p>
<p>
Having in my youth been a great fan of Geoff Crammond's C64
classic 'the Sentinel', and seeing that so far there
seems to be no runnable linux remake for the game, and also
feeling that this game would easily lend itself to OpenGL
programming, I chose making a remake of this game to be a
worthwhile task for a first project using OpenGL with the prospects of
<ul>
<li>sending it up to the GitHub as an open source reference project.</li>
<li>in fact learning and applying the basics of OpenGL.</li>
<li>finally playing a decent game of Sentinel again. :-)</li>
</ul>
