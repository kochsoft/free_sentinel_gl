This remake of the 1986 Firebird C64 classic 'the Sentinel'
was written by Markus-Hermann Koch during the weeks between
April 29th 2015 and May 25th 2015 as a self-tutoring project
in order to learn how to work with openGL in C++.
</p>
<p>
Sentinel GL has some subtle gaming differences to the original
it is a remake of.
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Slopes bridge plateaus of different heights in single steps.</li>
<li>The game may be setup thus that antagonists turn in random directions.
In any case they are not above turning back on the player in order to
truly center their attention on the synthoid.</li>
<li>
Also antagonists will continue to attack even while disintegrating.
It is also still possible to absorb matter while
the sentinel is already dissolving.
</li>
<li>
All kinds of attacks have become more dangerous. The synthoid
features a mind shield that will protect it perfectly for a moment.
It also will recharge instantly should the synthoid escape attack
for even a fraction of a second. However, once the shield is worn down
all attacks are cumulative absorbing the synthoid very fast if
it is caught by several antagonists at once. Do not underestimate
antagonists you have partial cover from either, even if no trees are
present. Their attacks, too, will wear down the psionic shield and will
keep it down even if the partial attack is the only one; and should
the synthoid transfer to a place of full antagonist surveyal it
will go there without defence. Finally note that meanies do not need
to see the synthoid's robot shell fully in order to invert its
hyperdrive coils.
</li>
<li>In addition to a simple campaign mode mimicing the original game
there is also a challenge mode to more dynamically setup a challenge
of appropriate difficulty. Plus there is a custom game setup
offering to adjust many settings as you see fit.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
As to the settings:
<ul>
<li>Campaign code: Starting at 0 this will be updated as you play
campaign levels. Enter a valid campaign code to play a more difficult
challenge. Start using the start button right beside the textbox.</li>
<li>Challenge slide bar: Slide to the right in order to get a
more difficult random challenge. Start using the attached start button.</li>
<li>Sentries: For custom games. How many sentries should the map have?</li>
<li>Gravity: For custom games. The lower the gravity of a landscape
the higher mountains can stand stable without sliding off.</li>
<li>Age: For custom games. The younger a landscape the more rugged
its scenery.</li>
<li>System energy: For custom games. A rough indicator to how many trees a newly
generated landscape will contain.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
General setting affecting all types of game.
<ul>
<li>Rotation type: Should antagonists spin to the left, to the right,
or in a randomized fashion?</li>
<li>Spin period: So much time it will take a general antagonist to
perform a full rotation.</li>
<li>Self spin: The same for the synthoid at full rotation speed.
The default value is rather sluggish. To counter this Keep the u-turn
function in mind!</li>
<li>Antagonist Field of View: The horizontal angle an antagonist
surveys at any given time in degrees.</li>
<li>Psi shield: If the synthoid comes under any attack his natural
psychic isolation will protect it for that many seconds from any harm.</li>
<li>Confidence: After the psionic shield has worn down it depends
on the confidence how fast the synthoid takes damage
over time.</li>
<li>Object resilience: Think of it as 'confidence' for inanimate
matter like robot shells or boulders. The higher the value the longer
the antagonists will need to absorb energy from these objects.</li>
<li>Random scenery: Each gravity level has an
appropriate scenery befitting the setting; whether it takes place
on Earth, the Moon, Mars or other celestial bodies. This option
allows for random scenery independent of the gravity level
governing the site.</li>
<li>Meanies: If unchecked the antagonists will not be able to
transmute trees into meanies.</li>
</ul>
