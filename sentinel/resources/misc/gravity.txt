# Planetary config data.
# From simplest difficulty (greatest gravity) to the most difficult.
# Structure:
# Each planetary data block begins with a line of the form
# KEY MAINKEY
# This will cause the parsing function form_main::parse_config_file(..)
# to create a new planetary entry of the map key MAINKEY.
# This MAINKEY will be active until the next line starting with "KEY "
# is encountered.
# After that every line starts with a subkey like e.g. NAME.
#
# NAME: Used e.g. in the combobox in the game setup window.
# DESC: Short description for the planet.
# LIGHT: Light color for the planet in openGL RGB.
# SCENERY: As in the enum E_SCENERY for assigning the scenery texture theme.
